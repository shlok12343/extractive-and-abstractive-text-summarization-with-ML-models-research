Deep Learning for Computer Vision

Introduction to Computer Vision

Computer Vision is a field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world. Using digital images from cameras and videos and deep learning models, machines can accurately identify and classify objects — and then react to what they “see.” The goal of computer vision is to automate tasks that the human visual system can do.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery. They are inspired by the organization of the animal visual cortex and are designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images.

Key Components of a CNN:

1.  **Convolutional Layer**: The core building block of a CNN. This layer performs a convolution operation, which involves sliding a filter (or kernel) over the input image to produce a feature map. The filter is a small matrix of weights that detects specific features like edges, corners, and textures.

2.  **Activation Function (ReLU)**: After the convolution, an activation function is applied to introduce non-linearity into the model. The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) is the most commonly used activation function in CNNs. It replaces all negative pixel values in the feature map with zero.

3.  **Pooling Layer**: This layer is used to reduce the spatial dimensions (width and height) of the input volume for the next convolutional layer. It helps in making the model more robust to variations in the position of features in the image. Max pooling is the most common type, which takes the maximum value from a pool of units in a feature map.

4.  **Fully Connected Layer**: After several convolutional and pooling layers, the high-level features are flattened into a one-dimensional vector and fed into one or more fully connected layers. This part of the network is similar to a traditional multi-layer perceptron and is responsible for making the final classification decision.

5.  **Softmax Layer**: For multi-class classification, a softmax function is typically used in the final layer to output a probability distribution over the classes.

Image Classification

Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision where the goal is to assign a label to an input image from a predefined set of categories. For example, a model might be trained to classify images as containing a 'cat', 'dog', or 'bird'.

The process for image classification using a CNN is as follows:
1.  The input image is fed into the CNN.
2.  The convolutional and pooling layers extract features from the image.
3.  The fully connected layers use these features to learn the relationship between the image content and the labels.
4.  The softmax layer outputs the probability of the image belonging to each class.

Object Detection

Object detection is a more challenging task than image classification. It involves not only identifying which objects are in an image but also locating them by drawing a bounding box around each object.

Modern object detection models, such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) and Faster R-CNN, use CNNs as their backbone. The process generally involves two main parts:
1.  **Region Proposal**: The model first identifies potential regions in the image that might contain an object.
2.  **Classification and Bounding Box Regression**: For each proposed region, the model classifies the object and refines the coordinates of the bounding box to accurately locate it.

The ability of CNNs to learn hierarchical features makes them extremely powerful for these vision tasks. Lower layers might learn to detect simple features like edges, while deeper layers combine these to detect more complex structures like eyes, faces, and eventually entire objects. This hierarchical learning is key to the success of deep learning in computer vision.
